// two types of datatypese are present 1. premitive 2. object 
let num 
num=4
let username = "navin" 
let account = "harsha's account"
console.log(username)
console.log(account)
let s = num/0    

// infinity returned 



// let is the key word used  for the declaration of the variable 
// in can take any kind of input no need to mention the datatypes of the inputings
// strings can be represneted with both "" and '' 
// let keyword ,basically let us to declare the anydatatype intaking varaible 
const pi = 3.14

// const key word makes the variable initialized variable constant donot let to change after initialized once 
// its like define in c where we keep our global constant in define section
console.log(typeof pi)

// when we check the datatype of the pi  we get number as its type 
// we can store float values and hexadecimal values also exponential values int number datatype itself

let expo = 21e10         // this is an exponential function means it adds 10^10 zeros to the existing 21 
console.log(expo)
console.log(typeof expo)  // this function here gives the type of datatype
